	<ul>
		<li>Start the Amazon EC2 instances <a href="https://project2-ec2-dashboard.osl-cloud.com/" target="ec2">here</a><br/>(If you don't know which ones to start, start them all!  Instances are set to automatically shutdown, if ticked, at 7pm each night.)</li>

	<summary><h2>Runnning the Demo</h2></summary>
	<p>The demo is a fully working 'real' environment, and you are free to wander around and invoke what functions you will.  Two fictious distributors have been setup, each with its own different web site through which you can purchase Service Plans as members of the public:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/one" target="rq1">Distributor One Retail Website</a></li>
		<li><a href="/two" target="rq2">Distributor Two Retail Website</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>For distributor, garage and head office staff, there is a further portal that allows for the management of all aspects of Service Plans, as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://project2-scp.osl-cloud.com" target="scp">Users' Portal</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following login credentials should be available to use:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Distributor One - testuser1@distributerone.co.uk / testing123</li>
		<li>Distributor Two - testuser1@distributertwo.co.uk / testing123</li>
		<li>Garage Manager - garagemgr@somegarage.co.uk / testing123</li>
		<li>Head Office Manager - senmgr@headoffice.co.uk / testing123</li>
	</ul>
