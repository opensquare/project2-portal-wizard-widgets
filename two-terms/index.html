		<h1>SERVICE PLAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>

		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

		<p>These are the terms and conditions on which the Service Plan is provided. This document, together with Service Plan Schedule, forms the basis of the contract between you and Quindell for the Service Plan (this "Agreement"). The provisions of this Agreement are binding as between you and Quindell once we confirm to you in writing acceptance of the Service Plan. We will confirm to you acceptance of the Service Plan once we have received the Plan Payment by you or on your behalf. </p>

		<h2>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</h2>

		<p>In order for the Vehicle to be eligible for cover under the Service Plan, it is essential that your Vehicle complies with the following.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Must be a passenger or light commercial vehicle with a payload capacity of less than 1200KG;</li>
			<li>Must not exceed the gross vehicle mass of 3500kg;</li>
			<li>Must be in sound mechanical condition;</li>
			<li>Must not be a taxi, hire vehicle, rebuilt vehicle, kit car, modified vehicle (including turbo, supercharger or LPG conversions) or any vehicle that is or has been used in any form of motoring competition;</li>
			<li>Must have a valid MOT certificate (where applicable); and</li>
			<li>Must have a recorded mileage of less than 100,000 miles at the start of the Service Plan.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your vehicle meets these requirements. </p>

		<p>Prior to purchasing the Service Plan the Vehicle must have been serviced in accordance with the manufacturers servicing schedule. Proof of service history including VAT receipts for such vehicle services may be required. For the avoidance of doubt, Quindell  will not be responsible for carrying out any scheduled vehicle services which were due to be undertaken prior to the Service Plan becoming effective.</p>

		<p>If you benefit from other products or services that require the Vehicle to be serviced at other nominated suppliers, this plan may be unsuitable. You will be deemed to have checked the terms of such other products and services prior to purchasing the plan and Quindell will not be responsible for any effect work undertaken as part of the Service Plan may have on them.</p>

		<h2>PAYMENT</h2>

		<p>Payment of the Plan Payment shall be in accordance with the details given in the Service Plan Schedule. Where you pay the Plan Payment in instalments, this will be managed through a Credit Provider such instalments will be payable at the times and intervals specified in the credit agreement agreed between yourself and the Credit Provider.  </p>

		<p>Where you are paying by instalments, you will be required to pay sufficient funds to cover the cost of the first service due under the Service Plan. Please note that if at any time the balance of your Plan Payment is not sufficient, to cover the value of the service due under the Service Plan, whether this is caused by either: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>you failing to keep up with the scheduled instalments detailed on the Service Plan Schedule; or </li>
			<li>you exceeding your declared Annual Mileage in any given twelve month period  </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Then we may recalculate the Plan Mileage and advise the Credit Provider to adjust the Plan Payment accordingly and you will be required to make a balancing payment, to bring the balance of your Plan Payment into line with the scheduled services required by you. Where possible we will try and give you 28 days" notice of any adjustment to the Plan Payment.</p>

		<h2>THE LENGTH OF THE SERVICE PLAN</h2>

		<p>This Agreement and the Service Plan will begin from such time as we provide written confirmation of acceptance of the Service Plan and shall continue until either:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the Plan Term expires; or</li>
			<li>the Agreement is cancelled by you, or terminated by us, in accordance with its terms and conditions.</li>
		</ul>
